# ❄ Troubleshooting

## Things I have encountered...

* 90% of all problems result from a too weak USB hub. The USB miner Gekkoscience Compac F (and probably all other USB miners) wants power, and not too little.

* A miner connected to a hub will probably always work by throttling the frequency (MHz). But of course you want to get the maximum out of it and don't want to settle for below average performance. Only a better hub can help here!

* With two miners it showed up for me that really only special hardware (e.g. the Gekkoscience USB Hub for 100€ (without power supply)) delivers the desired result. See chapter [multiple-usb-miner.md](multiple-usb-miner.md "mention"). Of course I have no possibility to test all hubs. If there are experience values from other users, I can add them here with pleasure.

* Insufficient cooling seems to make the miner run unstable. It is strongly recommended to actively cool the miner from a clock speed of 200MHz. This should also have a positive effect on the lifetime of the miner. See also the chapter [uebertakten.md](uebertakten.md "mention").

* For debugging under Linux you need to have a basic understanding of files and paths. See the link on this subpage: [💡 Hilfreiche Kommandos für erleichterte Bedienung unter Linux/Raspberry Pi](LinuxCommands.md)
