# Grocery list

## - Host PC: Very diverse options!

> * Raspberry Pi Zero with GPIO header - additionally required: [Waveshare Ethernet/USB HUB HAT for Raspberry Pi](https://amzn.eu/d/bvdLxCD)
> * Raspberry Pi (it doesn't matter which one; Raspberry Pi 3 or Raspberry Pi 4 are quite current devices) and the RAM size doesn't matter
> * Windows or Linux computers
> * possibly via your own node - Node OS (Ciatdel) unfortunately does not recognize the USB miner. Maybe someone will get it for themselves. Raspiblitz works without any problems and is mainly covered on the following pages.

## - [GekkoScience NewPac 22 to 45 GH/s](https://www.bitshopper.de/shop/sha-256-miner/usb-miner-bitcoin/newpac/)

> * overclocked to around 100 GH/s
> * the Gekko Newpac USB Miner is no longer produced and is only available to a limited extent on the page linked above (approx. 70 pieces; as of June 2022)
> * Another miner such as the successor to Newpac can also be ordered:

## - [GekkoScience Compac F 200 to 400 GH/s](https://www.bitshopper.de/shop/sha-256-miner/usb-miner-bitcoin/compac-f/)

> * overclocked to around 400 GH/s
> * This is expected to be available again from the end of July 2022

## - Active USB hub

> * Bitshopper: [7-port USB hub with 6-pin PCIe connection](https://www.bitshopper.de/shop/zubehoer/7-port-usb-hub/) (**Reference if several USB miners should be operated**)
> * Amazon: [RSHTECH Aluminum USB Hub Active 3.0 with 36W (12V / 3A)](https://amzn.eu/d/7eHrU5X)
> * Amazon: [USB Hub Active 3.0 with 24W (12V/2A) power supply, USB 3.0 Hub Active with 5 ports (USB 3.0 data port x 4, fast charging port x 1) with independent on/off switch and LED, gray](https: //amzn.eu/d/9QPdNLB)


## - Cooling the miner

> * absolutely necessary from a clock frequency of 100 MHz! The Compac F Miner must always be used with cooling!
> * Amazon: [ARCTIC Breeze Mobile - 92 mm USB fan with flexible neck](https://amzn.eu/d/hDWkNy5)
> * Enclosure for 3D printing: [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4947599) - PLA, PETG,... (attached with cable ties)
> * Housing for 3D printing: [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2694546) - use PETG or similar! PLA softens more quickly and could slip off!
> * if necessary [larger fans for cases](https://www.digitalo.de/products/1120184/BeQuiet-Pure-Wings-2-PWM-PC-Gehaeuse-Luefter-Schwarz-B-x-H-x-D-120-x-120 -x-25mm.html)
