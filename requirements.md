Since the most common way for solo mining is with a Raspberry Pi, we will describe in detail here how to set one up and start mining later.

In order to set up the Raspberry Pi and install everything necessary, the device must be accessed. There are two different common methods for this.

* Via the network from your own computer (SSH)
* Display, keyboard and, if necessary, mouse connected to the Raspberry Pi

The first method is the more convenient because the Raspberry Pi only needs to be connected to power and internet. This means it can be anywhere, as long as it is in the same network (preferably via LAN) as the computer from which the Raspberry Pi is to be operated.
The second method is initially more intuitive for anyone who has never used the command line (terminal) on a computer. To set it up, the Raspberry Pi is then connected to a display and the entries are made using a directly connected keyboard. A big disadvantage is that all commands either have to be typed in manually or transferred to the Raspberry (as a file or via the Internet).
The following describes the way to prepare the Raspberry Pi for mining and start mining using the first method, i.e. via SSH. The whole setup is just “copy and paste”, so even beginners should try the method via SSH before setting up a display and keyboard for the Raspberry Pi.
